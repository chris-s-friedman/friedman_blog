<p>One of my favorite things is beer<a href="#fn1" class="footnoteRef" id="fnref1"><sup>1</sup></a>. For me, it’s not just a fizzy yellow drink.</p>
<p>Disclaimer: Yes, I have waited in line outside of a brewery before. And yes, I have been known to annoy friends by using phrases like “this beer’s nose” or “a pleasant mouthfeel.” That said, I do believe that every beer has a place in the world. Philly’s Yeungling and Baltimore’s Natty Boh hold as much of a place in my heart as <a href="https://www.beeradvocate.com/beer/profile/201/45309/">Oerbier 2007</a> and hazy northeast milkshake IPAs.</p>
<p>One of the best things about living in Philadelphia, and the mid-atlantic for that matter, is that the area has a wonderfully thriving beer scene. This is something I don’t have data for, but I feel safe with the hunch that I could go to a brewery within an hour of my home and drink a beer I’ve never had before. Every Night. It really is a rich scene, folks.</p>
<p>Anyway, there are so many breweries out here that I want to learn about them, and try to see if I can gain an insight into the Philly beer scene. Perhaps I can learn something about the place that any brewery in Philly holds within the scene? Maybe down the road I can figure out what makes the Philly beer scene unique across the country. Hopefully, it isn’t just close proximity to great cheesesteaks!</p>

<h2>What kind of data do I want?</h2>
<p>When I started to think about how I would go about getting data on Philadelphian Beer, the first place that I went to was to think about the Philadelphia Breweries. Before I jumped into data, I realized that although the beer scene here is large, there is no way I would be able to learn much by just looking at information about breweries.</p>
<p>I need to look at the beer they make too!</p>
<p>Okay, so I need information about breweries and about the beer breweries make. Easy enough. Someone must have an API that has both of those kinds of data?</p>
