<p>This is a continuation of my work on the <a href="https://discuss.codecademy.com/t/data-science-independent-project-1-watching-the-stock-market/419943">codeacademy data science independant project #1: Watching the Stock Market</a>.</p>
<ul>
<li>My <a href="../../07/creating-a-stocks-database/">first post</a> on the subject explores how I put gathered the stock data.</li>
<li>In my <a href="../../07/working-with-stocks-basic-sql">second post</a>, I explored the data using basic sql queries (and put my sql code out into the world for the first time!)</li>
</ul>
<hr />
<p>Intermediate Challenge</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>Explore using aggregate functions to look at key statistics about the data (e.g., min, max, average).</li>
<li>Group the data by stock and repeat. How do the stocks compare to each other?</li>
<li>Group the data by day or hour of day. Does day of week or time of day impact prices?</li>
<li>Which of the rows have a price greater than the average of all prices in the dataset?</li>
</ol>
<p>Advanced Challenge</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li>In addition to the built-in aggregate functions, explore ways to calculate other key statistics about the data, such as the median or variance.
<ul>
<li>Hint: See <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15763965/how-can-i-calculate-the-median-of-values-in-sqlite/15766121#15766121">here</a> and <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2298339/standard-deviation-for-sqlite/4621268#4621268">here</a> for possible solutions.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Let’s refactor the data into 2 tables - stock_info to store general info about the stock itself (ie. symbol, name) and stock_prices to store the collected data on price (ie. symbol, datetime, price).
<ul>
<li>Hint: You can use the SQL CREATE TABLE AS statement to create a table by copying the columns of an existing table. Don’t forget to also drop certain columns from the original table and rename it.</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Now, we do not need to repeat both symbol and name for each row of price data. Instead, join the 2 tables in order to view more information on the stock with each row of price.</li>
<li>Add more variables to the stock_info table and update the data (e.g., sector, industry, etc).</li>
</ol>
